# ADL-GAN

This repository contains codes used to conduct experiments in ADL-GAN: Data Augmentation to Improve In-the-wild ADL Recognition using GANs paper.
We proposed GAN-based models to augment smartphone sensor data for Activity of Daily Living (ADL) recognition task. We will upload model and include more details after paper publication.
